## Here is some concept/library/functions I use


- #firebase_auth - authentication login/registration

- #firestore DB -realtime database with some CRUD operation

- provider lib- to #manipulate app data according to #realtime data and inherited from to another screen using streams

- #Streambuilder - to make dynamic widgets w.r.t current data states I.e #login page or home according to user data

- #forms - with custom validation makes it more #secure

- #try_catch - catching logical errors I.e wrong password with GUI changes

- #custom_Navigator - you can't use default navigator when you're passing data one to another, so here is custom navigator
